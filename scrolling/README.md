# jQuery (more stuff)

We've covered some basics of jQuery including binding functions to elements, changing style, etc.

If we look at a quick snippet to refresh:

```
$('#element').click(function(event) {
	console.log('You clicked' + this);
})
```

We're binding a function, the `function() { console... }` to the item with the ID `#element`, so that any time it's clicked it logs into the console.

The `this` refers to the item that was clicked. `this` as a variable is always going to be set as the element the function was called on.

### Animations

jQuery is used for animation a lot.

A good example is:

```
$( "#element" ).click(function(event) {
  $( "#element2" ).animate({
    opacity: .25
  }, 1000, function() {
    console.log('animation complete');
  });
});
```

This code is again binding a function to `#element`—this time, the function is an animation.

The animation is called with $('#element').animate(properties [,duration ][, easing ][, complete ])

`properties` is, for example, `opacity: .25`. It's what you're going to be changing during the animation.

`duration` is the length in milliseconds the animation should take.

`complete` is a function that's called when the animation is finished.

Check out `example1.html` to see this in action.

### Scrolling with .animate()

We can implement animated scrolling with a property called `scrollTop`.

`scrollTop` is the position on the page of the top of the scroll-bar in the browser. 

By changing scrollTop for the `html` selector we can essentially scroll through the webpage.

Usually when we click an `<a href="..."></a>` tag it immediately takes us to the element. Using Javascript alone, we can stop this, using `event.preventDefault()`.

```
$('#anchor').click(function(event) {
	event.preventDefault();
})
```

Let's break a website!

Go to reddit.com and open console and copy the line:

`$('a').click(function(event) {event.preventDefault()})`

into the developer console.

This doesn't work for a lot of newer websites that already have the default behavior disabled. Reddit's front end is primitive, though, so we can break it.


### The actual challenge

Create a basic webpage using `template.html` that:

* Has a number of elements spaced throughout it for scrolling to (<div>s, whatever)
* Has <a> tags that link to the elements
* Prevents the default action on <a> clicks
* Performs a jQuery scroll animation to the target element

To perform a scroll using .animate() we first need to identify the arguments of the function we'll need.

As we've said, we want to change the `scrollTop` property of the entire webpage—essentially, $('html').
